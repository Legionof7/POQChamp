# POQChamp-Proof of Quantum



POQChamp is a mini blockchain built with Cirq and ProjectQ. I used [Snakecoin](https://gist.github.com/aunyks/8f2c2fd51cc17f342737917e1c2582e2) for most of it.


# REEEEEEE WHY IS THIS CALLED POQ THERE'S NO PROOF OF QUANTUM INVOLVED

It sounds cool.

# This sucks. I found Vulnerability X/It's centralized/XRP is better

Yeah but I wanted to play with Cirq. Please no hate.
